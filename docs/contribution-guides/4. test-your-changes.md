## 4. Test Your Changes

After making changes, you should make sure they are working as expected and not breaking the existing unit tests.

1. Test your changes locally.

 !!! TODO

2. Run unit tests locally.

   1. Go to the project root directory.

        ```shell
        # navigate to the repository
        cd communication-services-authentication-hero-nodejs/
        ```

   2. run the existing unit tests

        You have 2 possibilities depending on displaying test coverage or not.
        1. if you do not want to display the test coverage:

            ```shell
            # Run UTs
            npm run test
            ```

        2. if you do want to display the test coverage:

            ```shell
            # Run UTs with coverage
            npm run test:coverage
            ```

    >  Note: UTs are part of our CI pipeline, so failing UTs will result in repo build failure. Also, we defined a global test coverage threshold of **80%** for branches, lines and statements. If the global coverage for any of them is below this threshold, UTs will fail.
